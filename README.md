# Tasker

Tasker is a full-stack web application where you can save, add and edit General Tasks, Notes and Links for each specific subject of your choosing. It's a type of Organizer where you can just pull it up and everything will be in one place and organized. It will be your starting place for whenever you're ready to work and/or study. No need to carry around several notebooks for each individual subject or tasks. Tasker is unique to each user since I included a User model as well as others to save the custom tasks, subjects etc. to the Django database.

Created with Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS. This was my Final Project for the advanced CS50 class called Web Programming with Python and Javascript.
